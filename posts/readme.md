Last update: Mar 6, 2023

## 🚚 Logistics

- I live in Kaunas, Lithuania
- I know how to work acrross mutiple timezones and never had any issues collaborating with teammates who are spread across the world.
- I'm deeply invested in my career development. I do believe in work-life integration and I'm totally OK working long hours, because i really enjoy what I'm doing.

## 🌐 Communication

- Slack: If I’m working, I’m on Slack. My Slack is open for anyone in the company. DMs are great, group messages are better, pings in a public channels are the best. I value transparency and being open by default.
- Email: Email is a tool that I chose to master, so I have "Inbox Zero" policy for all my email clients. You will get a response from me within 24 hours no matter what.
- Notifications and document @mentions: I respond to them when I triage my email
- Meetings: Meetings are expensive, take a lot of time and, in most cases, it’s better to send an email, however, I do find a lot of value in casual banter with my co-workers. Because of that my calendar is open for you and I trust that you will use your best judgement when scheduling a meeting with me.

## 👍 Things I value

- Being organized
- Customer feedback
- Making fast decisions
- Incremental product updates
- Good strategy is hard. I value companies and teams that have it
- Challenging discussions and a good banter
- Personal growth

## 👎 Things that drive me nuts

- _Micromagement:_ I don't work in a kindergarten
- _[Seagull management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seagull_management)_: please don't do this
- _Shifting blame on external factors:_ Let’s talk about realistic variables that we can control and learn from
- _Not owning your own mistakes:_ That’s another way to shift blame. Let’s talk about what actually happened and do better next time

## ⭐ How can people earn an extra gold star with me?

- I admire people who push out information about their work status. This way when I need that information I don’t need to ask for it
- I look up to people who are organized. Yes, things sometimes get out of control for everyone, however, general organization and discipline is really important
- Tell me how I can improve

## 🤷 What are some things that people might misunderstand about me?

- _I take things seriously:_ When I crack jokes people sometimes think that I don’t take things seriously. I do. Jokes are meant to lighten the mood even if the topic that we are discussing is really serious
- _I know how to code:_ Yup. Even though I'm usually not allowed to touch codebases at my work, I actually write code for fun to experiment with new technologies.
- _Strong opinions loosely held:_ I always drive for solutions, but that does not mean that my solutions are the best ones. I will always have strong position about my work, but please do tell me if my solution is wrong even when I’m not asking for feedback. We can then discuss and adjust. The best products are born in continuous feedback cycles
- _I do sleep:_ people often ask me if I ever sleep. I do

## ☄️ How do I give feedback?

Depends on feedback. I follow general principles and will never call you out in public for doing something wrong. I will give this feedback via Slack or during a 1:1 meeting.

## 👀 How do I like to receive feedback

Just tell me things straight no matter the venue. It's really hard to offend me.

## 🪄 Areas of improvement

- _Escapism:_ I do enjoy trying out new things and take extra effort to escape the ordinary
- _Asking for help:_ Sometimes I spend too much time trying to figure out stuff on my own, before I ask for help.

## 🍿 What are some honest, unfiltered things about me?

- _I thrive in uncertainty:_ especially if there’s an opportunity to achieve great business outcomes
- _I will do anything to ship the product:_ Yes! Anything. Just tell me what I need to do and I will do it. Always
- _I am a generalist:_ Some people call it “jack of all trades” and I like to call it “master of versatility”
- _I embrace the suck:_ Monotonous and repetitive tasks are part of the game
- _Every experience feeds ideas:_ I do believe in that and always try to experience something new
- _I'm really competitive:_ I love competition! I embrace it and will always look for ways to be ahead
- _Sci-fi audiobook addict:_ Over 100 sci-fi audiobooks in my Audible library.
