I love experimentation, iteration, creating proofs of concept, and strongly believe that any code that is not in production is completely useless. That being said, as a person who ships software products for a living, the **#1 struggle** i have is launching something that is “good enough”. 

Product launch that is “good enough” really means that
> “We just launched something that meets some baseline expectations of our potential buyers who use similar products already”. 

I’m talking about products that are just another iteration of something that is out there. They have some new features, yes, but usually lack something that is already planned for V2. Basically, a net zero gain for the user that improves on some meaningless metric for a company. Moreover, the overall experience feels quirky. Buttons are missplaced, transitions feel strange, and the overall experience is just really dull.

Looking back, I realize that I’ve launched way too many iterations that feel just like that. There’s no glamour, no one’s really proud of it, we didn’t learn anything new nor did we innovate in any meaningful way. I basically did my job, rallied the troops, made some money and padded my LinkedIn credentials.

I must admit, that for a person, who is a terminal workaholic an exchange of “endless hours of work for increasing amounts of $$$” doesn’t make that much sense anymore. It took me a good part of the year to understand the missing piece here. To be a happy product builder, I need to believe that what I’m launching is my life’s work, and i need to be surrounded by people who hold the same belief as well. Is it possible? I believe it is.

One can always feel when a product they just purchased was built by people who really poured their hearts and souls into it. Artisan handcrafted physical goods are a classical example here, and to this day no one can beat the overall experience that Apple offers. 

As for software, i vividly remember my excitement when I tried [Arc](https://arc.net/) browser for the first time. I literally recorded their product onboarding on my phone, because it **felt** awesome. Later i came across their [culture handbook](https://thebrowser.company/values/) that basically explained the reason why their browser felt so damn great. “Showing up with a heartfelt intensity” is their key value. That’s it! 

That’s what you need to really innovate in an already crowded browser space. That’s what Superhuman probably needed to handcraft a superior email experience for people who's main job is to respond to email. That’s what Slack [instilled in their culture](https://medium.com/@stewart/we-dont-sell-saddles-here-4c59524d650d) when they created the first work chat product.

All these products, of course, started in a rough state, some things were broken, and some features didn't meet the quality bar. In the end, however, the attention to detail
